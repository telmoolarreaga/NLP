poll prestigious colleges wo nt make you happier in life or work there s plenty of anxiety in the us over getting into a top college but a new gallup poll suggests that later in life it does nt matter nearly as much as we think in fact when you ask college graduates whether they re engaged with their work or thriving in all aspects of their lives their responses do nt vary one bit whether they went to a prestigious college or not the surprising findings come in a survey of 29650 college graduates of all ages by gallup pollsters working with researchers at purdue university the poll asked graduates a range of questions designed to measure how well they are doing in life across factors such as income and engagement in their jobs and careers the survey set a high bar it found that 39 percent of college grads overall say they re engaged at work which is 10 points higher than the population at large and while almost 5 in 6 selfreport doing great in at least one sphere whether sense of purpose financial security physical health close relationships or community pride only 11 percent are thriving in all five areas of wellbeing those percentages did not vary based on whether the grads went to a fancy namebrand school or a regional state college one of the top 100 in the us news world report rankings or one of the bottom 100 a slight edge did go to those who attended campuses with more than 10000 students while forprofit college graduates saw worse outcomes no opinion poll can fully capture the impact or allure of attending a worldfamous institution but this is nt the first time studies have documented no edge for highly selective schools previous studies have shown no link between expensive private colleges and later salary for graduates income is much more closely tied to a person s choice of a major which is a finding the gallup survey also supported highend colleges often boast that their longterm results should be judged not by looking at paychecks but at whether their graduates live lives of meaning and deep satisfaction a college degree should be a passport to a lifetime of citizenship opportunity growth and change wrote harvard s president drew gilpin faust in a letter to the new york times last year well this survey asked about all that qualitative stuff purpose motivation to achieve goals opportunity to learn and grow and it did nt find any broad influence whatsoever whether a person s diploma cost 25000 or 250000 for gallup wellbeing and engagement are nt squishy they have very specific meanings in surveys of 25 million people over a number of years the researchers have asked similar questions and correlated the responses across populations with income health employee turnover company revenue and other hard indexes the graduate survey released tuesday suggests the factors that should be guiding college decisions are not selectivity or prestige but cost of attendance great teaching and deep learning in that order that s because graduates who said they had a mentor who encouraged my hopes and dreams professors who cared about me and at least one prof who made me excited about learning are three times more likely to be thriving and twice as likely to be engaged at work in a similar vein grads who did longterm projects and internships and were heavily into extracurriculars are twice as likely to be engaged in their careers today college debt also has a big impact on the negative side only 2 percent of those with 20000 to 40000 in undergraduate loans reported they were thriving that s pretty troubling since 29400 is the national average for the 7 in 10 students who borrow gallup and purdue hope to use these and future surveys to help colleges better focus on outcomes and to identify outlier colleges that are doing a great job delivering quality experiences for an affordable price in the meantime the takehome message for students is clear says brandon busteed who leads gallup s education work if you can go to podunk u debt free vs harvard for 100000 go to podunk and concentrate on what you do when you get there,Gallup poll finds prestigious colleges don't make you happier in life or work. 39 percent of college grads overall say they re engaged at work which is 10 points higher than the population at large. Almost 5 in 6 selfreport doing great in at least one sphere whether sense of purpose financial security ph Only 11 percent are thriving in all five areas of wellbeing. Percentage did not vary based on whether the grads went to a fancy namebrand school or a regional state college. A slight edge did go to those who attended campuses with more than 10000 students. Survey finds no broad influence whatsoever whether a person s diploma cost 25000 or 250000. Factors that should be guiding college decisions are not selectivity or prestige but cost of attendance great teaching and deep learning. Only 2 percent of those with 20000 to 40000 in undergraduate loans reported they were thriving. 7 in 10 students who borrow gallup and purdue hope to use these surveys to help colleges better focus on outcomes.
house speaker paul ryan at a private dinner earlier this year said he thought only one member wanted to build a wall across the entire usmexico border has learned from multiple sources with direct knowledge of the comments including former rep tom tancredo rco the dinner sources said took place on the eve of the house s passage of two relatively minor immigration bills at the end of june kate s law and sanctuary city reforms the far wider reaching davisoliver act was tabled at the same time ryan told a group of republicans he met with that only one person wants a wall tancredo told shortly after the dinner tancredo took issue with the speaker s characterization of support for the wall within the house gop of course he means only one person in his entourage and of the leadership he told i know several people in congress who want a wall and i know that there are millions of americans who want a wall you have to understand the level of fear that exists in the republican establishment about this issue tancredo told seeking to explain the pressures that republican members of congress face when addressing immigration the chamber of commerce doesn t want a wall the pressure is greater from the chamber of commerce than it is from the members tancredo who for years in the house fought a mostly fruitless battle to get congress to combat the flood of illegal immigration added that s the basic problem it was then it is now a current house gop member confirmed that ryan made a remark similar to the one tancredo referenced but stressed that the speaker was attempting to summarize the disparate voices in the house gop caucus telling all this narrative serves to inform is that ryan s is making a point of listening to members and that members mostly are trying to listen to each other i believe it is true that support for the wall is not as strong as it needs to be among house republicans that member added an assessment of the difficulties facing the effort to fund the wall according to this member who supports a border wall one of the biggest problems is republicans lack of knowledge of the history of the immigration issue and the failures to secure the border in the past the house member told another thing i have noticed is that members knowledge and opinions on immigration seem to only be traceable back to their arrival in congress not many brought much experience or knowledge on the topic with them 64 swore in january 2011 or later they only know that which was debated in the obama era some are never trumpers we have work to do the office of speaker ryan and another house gop member who was told attended the dinner neither confirmed nor denied that ryan made the comment about support for the wall the southern border wall is president donald trump s signature campaign promise and the ability of the republicancontrolled congress to deliver the authorization and funding will likely define the success or failure of the administration s immigration agenda as tancredo put it to every rally the president would whip up the crowd saying we re going to build a wall and so you had hopes that in putting so much rhetoric into it during the campaign that it would be hard to avoid it but so far they have found a way to do so so far no funding has been forthcoming with any mention of the wall dropped from the spring s gop budget proposals the white house itself was unclear as to when funding might be expected ryan interestingly has been claiming that the house has funded the border wall this year but the claims from his office that the housepassed funding measure fully funds the trump administration s request for a wall along the southern border are misleading at best what ryan s office is referring to in that release sent out on tuesday are the 12 appropriations bills those will not become law because ryan and senate majority leader mitch mcconnell failed to get them passed out of both chambers of congress and onto the president s desk as such president trump cut a temporary deal with the democrats to avert a government shutdown and raise the debt ceiling in a joint package tancredo was pessimistic the congressional republican leadership can be easily brought on board with the immigration agenda of the president and the party s conservative wing according to him ryan who was caught on tape after the emergence of the nowinfamous access hollywood recording of the president saying he was not going to defend donald trumpnot now not in the future would rather lose elections to democrats than seriously address the issue of illegal aliens ryan and the senate majority leader mitch mcconnell would rather have had hillary than donald trump for that very reason tancredo told they failed at stopping him and now they re going to have to stop him legislatively,House speaker paul ryan at a private dinner earlier this year said he thought only one member wanted to build a wall across the entire usmexico border. The dinner sources said took place on the eve of the house s passage of two relatively minor immigration bills. The chamber of commerce doesn't want a wall. The pressure is greater from the chamber of Commerce than it is from the members tancredo. The speaker was attempting to summarize the disparate voices in the house gop caucus. The southern border wall is president donald trump s signature campaign promise. The ability of the republicancontrolled congress to deliver the authorization and funding will likely define the success or failure of the administration s immigration agenda. No funding has been forthcoming with any mention of the wall dropped from the spring s gop budget proposals the white house itself was unclear as to when funding might be expected. President trump cut a temporary deal with the democrats to avert a government shutdown and raise the debt.  tancredo was pessimistic the congressional republican leadership can be easily brought on board with the immigration agenda of the president and the party s conservative wing. He was caught on tape after the emergence of the nowinfamous access hollywood recording of the President saying he was not going to defend donald trump.
cnn president donald trump has reason to hope his luck is changing after a long legal losing streak trump got to celebrate a big win wednesday in an emoluments clause case relating to his washington hotel and there are signs that a case in louisiana could cause yet another near death experience for obamacare his predecessor s top domestic achievement the courtroom action this week represents a potential reversal of fortune for trump following a long list of defeats the president has tasted on cases from immigration to the 2020 census to his efforts to thwart democratic oversight to his central campaign promise to build a border wall for a man who bills himself as one of life s ultimate winners trump s legal losing record is a branding nightmare yet the intimate relationship between this president and the courts actually goes beyond the winloss calculation that normally powers trump s life the judicial system serves multidimensional roles for trump in his personal business and washington life while the law has often frustrated trump s political goals he has still used it as a weapon to combat democrats as the glue in his conservative coalition and to postpone threatening political crises often as in the case of trump s national emergency declaration designed to fund his border wall or the census it seems as if the long odds in court do not deter the president the law gives trump another venue for the endless fights that sustain his politics and his personality even if he loses he is showing his supporters he s never giving up the battle trump s judicial appointments are likely to shape the character of american life for years after he s left the white house and it s still possible court rulings could pose an existential threat to his personal and business legacy given the flurry of cases currently open in new york as is often the case trump s wins in the courts have been outnumbered by his losses this week the administration has just tumbled to defeat before different judges including in the supreme court on its attempts to place a citizenship question on the 2020 census two significant court rulings in may upheld congress in its battle to subvert trump s war on oversight over democratic lawmakers efforts subpoena his financial records trump has also tasted defeat in huge cases on immigration slowing or thwarting his efforts to build his border wall and right at the start of his term on his original travel ban the supreme court has since allowed parts of a rewritten plan to stand research by the center for policy integrity at the university of new york school of law showed that the administration had won only three of 42 deregulatory cases a paltry success rate of only 7 yet trump s relationship with the courts is actually far more complicated than the winloss ratio with which he judges his own success and that of everyone around him in decades as a businessman trump was the initiator and the target of thousands of lawsuits he used the courts to try to extricate himself from dicey situations as a weapon in negotiations and to test the legal limits of business practice he used lawsuits to save face to offer a new venue to prolong a fight to put off a reckoning or agreed outofcourt settlements to limit the costs of personal and business liabilities as president trump has also used courts to fulfill wider goals than simply winning and losing cases especially since he s struggled to get many major bills through congress apart from a big tax reform program with bold assertions of executive power trump has made the courts a constant presence in his presidency when he s won he s trumpeted it when more often he loses the judgments become exhibits in his foundational political case that an elite establishment is out to get him and that he s being treated unfairly so now the obama appointed judge on the census case are you a citizen of the united states wo nt let the justice department use the lawyers that it wants to use could this be a first trump tweeted after a reverse in the census case on tuesday his frequent complaints about obama judges reveal his view that the courts are simply an extension of the political game and earned him a rebuke from chief justice john roberts administrations often try to achieve through the courts what they can not legislatively and the trump team along with allied gop states has been especially enthusiastic in this regard just this week in a hearing in new orleans two republicanappointed appellate judges appeared to suggest in oral arguments that a fresh challenge to obamacare could succeed the case also reflects the manner in which in an era of congressional stasis and polarization courts are being called upon to do the job lawmakers might once have done judge kurt engelhardt questioned why after a us district judge declared the whole aca unconstitutional congress did not pass a law clarifying what provisions should stay on the books why does congress want the judiciary to become the taxidermist for every legislative biggame accomplishment that congress achieves engelhardt asked the administration s legal gambits have often reflected the chaos and politicized arguments that rock the administration every day and have sometimes hampered its own chances of success last week for instance a justice department lawyer admitted he had no idea what was in trump s mind when he suddenly reversed course on the census case on twitter just watched justice department changes step following trump s tweet replay more videos must watch justice department changes step following trump s tweet 0151 sometimes trump has turned to personal litigation to try to frustrate his political enemies in march trump personally sued his own accounting firm and the chairman of the house oversight committee to try to stop the handover of his financial records the president has sometimes been the target of litigation as well democrats are increasingly turning to the courts to enforce subpoenas a huge test of presidential authority is looming over trump s sweeping claims of executive privilege that may eventually work their way up to the highest courts the cases could eventually lead to profound rulings about the scope of presidential power that could resonate for decades to come and if trump were to refuse to hand over documents or tax returns ordered by the courts he could turn overused predictions of a looming constitutional crisis into reality treasury secretary steven mnuchin s refusal to hand over trump s tax returns to a house committee under a provision of the tax code is likely to spark a long and costly court fight that s an example of where legal action suits trump just fine in such cases there s a good chance he will fail on the merits but the law s slow march means that he s at least putting off a threatening political situation for another day possibly even beyond the 2020 election each new challenge becomes a new example of the presidential harassment the term trump and his allies use to stoke a sense of victimhood around his administration and to solidify his support with his allimportant political base while the president may feel that he has a good chance of evading the worst possible outcome of robert mueller s special counsel probe he may not be out of the legal mire yet trump is facing multiple civil and criminal investigations of his business financial affairs personal conduct his foundation and inaugural committee just watched supreme court to decide future of daca replay more videos must watch supreme court to decide future of daca 0129 the political synergy between trump and the courts has an even deeper connection to his presidency than cases in which he is embroiled the president s decision to publicize a list of potential supreme court justices vetted by the federalist society was in retrospect one of the smartest moves of his 2016 campaign embedding evangelical and judicial conservatives into his support base despite doubts about his character and ideology trump has delivered on his vows to build a conservative majority on the supreme court with the seating of justices neil gorsuch and brett kavanaugh the court s new ideological balance means that rulings favorable to trump s leanings on everything from deregulation to abortion could be handed down for years to come and the president s alliance with senate republican majority leader mitch mcconnell has been confirming conservative judges to lower courts at an impressive clip according to the heritage foundation s judicial appointments tracker trump has installed 127 federal judges more than president barack obama s figure of 89 at the equivalent point in his presidency there is no guarantee that such judges will necessarily share trump s challenging and unique interpretations on the limits of presidential power but some of them could provide a more ideologically friendly judiciary for trump s policy efforts if he wins a second term and could help break his losing streak and the trump class of judges at all levels of the federal bench is likely to frustrate a future democratic president,Donald trump has reason to hope his luck is changing after a long legal losing streak. The intimate relationship between this president and the courts actually goes beyond the winloss calculation that normally powers trump s life. The judicial system serves multidimensional roles for trump in his personal business and washington life.

the controversial immigrationreform bill that passed the senate judiciary committee this week is expected to be considered by the senate in june many see measures contained in this bill such as a strong everify and a photo tool as a means to control unlawful immigrants access to unlawful employment i worry that they go too far i think there are better ideas that err on the side of individual privacy while still strengthening our borders we should scrap a national identification database and pass immigration reform that secures the border expands existing workvisa programs and prevents noncitizens from access to welfare these simple ideas will eliminate the perceived need for an invasive workerverification system and a government citizenship database i am against the idea that american citizens should be forced to carry around a national identification card as a condition of citizenship i worry that the senate is working to consider a series of littlenoticed provisions in comprehensive immigration reform that may provide a pathway to a national id card for all individuals present in the united states citizens and noncitizens these draconian ideas would simply give government too much power forcing americans to carry around an identification card to affirmatively prove citizenship offends our basic concept of freedom wanting to avoid a papers please culture in our country is also why conservatives oppose federal universal gun background checks we oppose such measures not because we don t believe in commonsense rules or regulation but because we are wary of giving the federal government this kind of centralized power over our daily lives i am against government lists of those who own or have transferred a firearm for the same reason i oppose any pathway to a national id i don t think that government should have the awesome power of monitoring the legal activities of american citizens that is not a proper role of the federal government or any level of government for that matter i am opposed to immigration reform that contains the photo tool that is contained in the interior enforcement and employment verification system title of the bill in the name of preventing the unlawful employment of aliens the senate legislation has a provision that enables employers to match the photo on a covered identify document provided to the employer to a photo maintained by the us citizenship and immigration services database this too is troubling this sounds like a national picture database of all citizens where the states house the picture and the department of homeland security is the clearinghouse for worker verification a national database of citizens raises the question what activities will require someone to present their papers a national id allows more power to gravitate to washington and a greater likelihood that power will be abused i will fight to remove the photo tool from this legislation because i think it will become a national id we already know the federal government is rife with false positives on the nofly list and the national instant check system for gun buyers why would we be foolish enough to think that a massive database of all citizens would not have the same problems on a grander scale we have a second amendment that must be protected we also have a fourth amendment that must be protected citizenship means that the government is supposed to protect our rights not take them away we must have stronger borders but there s no reason we can t have better security while respecting constitutional limits and liberties in the past week we have witnessed examples of the obama administration spying on the media and internal revenue service discrimination against tea party free speech people around the world always have dreamed of emigrating to america the land of the free it is our job to make sure our country stays that way sen rand paul kentucky republican is a member of the senate foreign relations and homeland security committees,The controversial immigrationreform bill that passed the senate judiciary committee this week is expected to be considered by the senate in june. Many see measures contained in this bill such as a strong everify and a photo tool as a means to control unlawful immigrants access to unlawful employment i worry that they go too far i think there are better ideas that err on the side of individual privacy while still strengthening our borders.  conservatives oppose federal universal gun background checks. Conservatives are wary of giving the federal government this kind of centralized power over our daily lives. Conservatives oppose immigration reform that may provide a pathway to a national id card. Senate legislation has a provision that enables employers to match the photo on a covered identify document to a photo maintained by the us citizenship and immigration services database. This sounds like a national picture database of all citizens where the states house the picture and the department of homeland security is the clearinghouse for worker verification. i will fight to remove the photo tool from this legislation because i think it will become a national id.

He says there s no reason we can't have better security while respecting constitutional limits and liberties. Sen. paul says the government is supposed to protect our rights not take them away.

wall street journal economics expert stephen moore tells that there is no case on economic grounds to heed president barack obama s call for higher taxes on wealthier americanshe says raising those rates would simply encourage wealthier taxpayers to hide their money and wouldn t boost revenues as predicted by the anticlinton president obamaand he warns that the expiration of the bushera tax cuts next year could cause a doubledip recessionmoore is a senior economics writer and editorial board member for the wall street journal he is the founder and former president of the club for growth and a bestselling author he also wrote the cover story for magazine s october issuemoore s new book is who s the fairest of them all the truth about opportunity taxes and wealth in america in an exclusive interview with tv moore was asked if obama and the democrats are advocating higher taxes on the wealthy to improve the economy or to win over middleclass voters i don t think anybody thinks that raising tax rates will improve the economy at least i certainly hope no one does because the history is so unequivocal that that s not the case moore says in fact what you want is lower tax rates not higher tax rates especially when we re living in a global economy where united states companies are competing against companies in india and china and germany and france and all over the world so there s no case on economic grounds for raising tax rates president obama is selling that idea on the grounds of fairness and that s really the reason i wrote this book to sort of define what does it really mean to be a fair society what i show in this research is that the fairest system of them all is the free enterprise system the free enterprise system is what creates growth creates jobs and higher living standards for almost all americans so it s hard to improve on that system president obama believes that the way to create a fairer system is to redistribute income from the rich to the poor that s never worked very well americans are an aspirational society and don t believe that rich people are evil moore adds most of us aspire to be rich and that s really the american dream to try to work hard start a business do the right thing so you can get rich and america s still the best country in the world to do that despite all the obstacles that government tries to create i think president obama is driven much more by an ideology that says redistribute wealth instead of creating it s almost like the wealth is just automatically there and all we have to do is just cut up that pie differently what i show in the book is that when you try to do that what happens is the pie shrinks and everybody is worse off vice president joe biden recently said the middle class has been buried during the last few years but moore argues that the demise of the middle class is a mythhe comments first of all let me say that the demise of the middle class over the last three years is very real we have seen a very steep decline in middle income earnings over the last three and a half years since president obama came into office there s been a 4500 decline in income that s huge that s one month s income what i was talking about in the book is over the last several decades in the 80s 90s and even the first of the 2000s the middle class did very well president obama says oh the recent decades have been a time of decline in the middle class that s not true the real decline of the middle class was george bush s last year in office and barack obama s first three and a half years in office moore points out that the wealthiest 10 percent of americans pay most of the taxes 75 percent of income taxes and 45 percent of all taxes yet some argue that the richest americans are still doing really well when compared to the other 90 percent and can afford to chip in a little more in taxes look we do need more tax revenues if we want to balance this budget there s absolutely no question about it moore says tax revenues as a percent of our gdp are lower than they ve been in 40 years my response to this argument about why not just soak the rich is that that s never really worked very well history proves if you want to get more revenues out of rich people cut their tax rates don t raise them that s a lesson that john f kennedy taught us ronald reagan taught us even george w bush taught us i don t think there s any evidence that raising tax rates way up is going to get more money out of the rich because the rich will find shelters they will find tax carveouts and loopholes and deductions to hide their money another argument from the left is that we should raise tax rates to where they were under president clinton president obama has pointed out that those rates did not slow down economic growth during clinton s tenuremoore takes issue with that point of view a couple of things he says one is that president obama doesn t want to just raise the rates to the clinton era he wants them to be a lot higher people forget that also in the obamacare healthcare law there s a 38 percent investment surtax so rates would actually go up about four percentage points higher than they were in the clinton administration but the other thing to point out is the clinton years were prosperous in part because under a republican congress and bill clinton who was a conservative in terms of his fiscal policies government spending fell as a share of gdp from 22 percent to 18 percent so that s like a tax cut when you cut government spending by four percentage points of gdp barack obama s done just the opposite he s raised gross spending by almost four percentage points of gdp we ve been averaging about 24 percent which is the highest it s been any time since world war ii when we were fighting the nazis and the japanese so the point i would make is that barack obama s kind of the anticlinton obama s not a fiscal conservative he s driven up the debt by over 1 trillion a year just last week the numbers came out that we had a 11 trillion deficit in 2012 that s four straight years with trilliondollar deficits that isn t fiscal conservatism that doesn t help anybody the bushera tax cuts are set to expire next year at the same time that automatic cuts in government spending are scheduled to take effect possibly leading to what some have called a fiscal cliff that makes this year s election crucial moore asserts the most important fiscal cliff is this tax increase and the reason this is such an important election is if barack obama wins he will have a mandate from voters to raise tax rates he tells i agree with the congressional budget office and a lot of other economists that that s something that could cause a double dip recession and if you think the economy s bad now wait until those tax rates go up in 2013 one of the arguments for mitt romney is he s actually going to cut the rates not raise them i do think we need spending cuts there s a lot of people who say that we can t afford to do these spending cuts next year yes we can afford to do that in fact we have to do that we have to start really taking a blade to government spending because that s so inefficient and every dollar the government spends is a dollar less the private sector has to spend on its own expansions mitt romney is vowing to cut taxes by 20 percent across the board and pay for those cuts by eliminating loopholes romney also says he believes in a progressive tax structure i like his tax plan moore says i don t agree with everything in it but i agree with the basic concept which ronald reagan did with dan rostenkowski and bob packwood and ted kennedy and democrats back in the 1980s it s amazing how the democrats have moved to the left back then what we did is we cut tax rates significantly very significantly and we closed off loopholes to make a much more efficient tax system and it worked really well that s what mitt romney for the most part is trying to do get rid of the pollution and the special interest carveouts in the tax system lower the rates for everybody it s been proven time again that s a very productive way to get the economy moving again the numbers can add up ronald reagan proved the numbers can add up when we did the 1986 tax act that lowered the rate all the way down to 28 percent we actually got more revenues into the treasury not less asked to give romney s plan a letter grade moore responds i ll give him a bplus the tax plan is strong and it will move us right in the right direction now i d like to see a flat tax i m a steve forbes guy one rate for everybody with no deductions no loopholes and you get rid of the double tax on saving and investment that would be the optimal tax system but mitt romney s plan moves us in that direction interestingly under mitt romney the top tax rate would be about 28 percent under barack obama the top tax rate goes up to 42 percent that s a big difference," stephen moore is a senior economics writer and editorial board member for the wall street journal. He is the founder and former president of the club for growth and a bestselling author. His new book is who s the fairest of them all the truth about opportunity taxes and wealth in america. What you want is lower tax rates not higher tax rates, says moore. Free enterprise system is what creates growth creates jobs and higher living standards for almost all americans, he says.  moore argues that the demise of the middle class is a myth. Most of us aspire to be rich and that s really the american dream to try to work hard start a business do the right thing so you can get rich. President obama says the recent decades have been a time of decline in the middle class that s not true. The real decline of the middleclass was george bush s last year in office and barack obama s first three and a half years in office moore points out that the wealthiest 10 percent of americans pay most of the taxes 75 percent of income taxes and 45 percent of all taxes. moore says there is no evidence that raising tax rates way up is going to get more money out of the rich. The rich will find shelters they will find tax carveouts and loopholes and deductions to hide their money. The clinton years were prosperous in part because under a republican congress and bill clinton who was a conservative in terms of his fiscal policies government spending fell as a share of gDP from 22 percent to 18 percent so that s like a tax cut. Barack obama s done just the opposite he s raised gross spending by almost four percentage points of gdp we ve been averaging about 24 percent. The bushera tax cuts are set to expire next year at the same time that automatic cuts in government spending are scheduled to take effect possibly leading to a fiscal cliff. moore asserts the most important fiscal cliff is this tax increase and the reason this is such an important election is if barack obama wins he will have a mandate from voters to raise tax rates. Mitt romney is vowing to cut taxes by 20 percent across the board and pay for those cuts by eliminating loopholes. Every dollar the government spends is a dollar less the private sector has to spend on its own expansions. romney says he believes in a progressive tax structure.  moore responds i ll give him a bplus the tax plan is strong and it will move us right in the right direction now i d like to see a flat tax i m a steve forbes guy one rate for everybody with no deductions no loopholes and you get rid of the double tax."
the left believes sanders s chances have improved but notes that obstacles still remain sanders reportedly pulled in about 345 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 which makes for a total sum of nearly 100 million no one else is even close those who lead in fundraising at this point often win in primaries in which an incumbent is not running in the given primary 9 of 14 leaders at this point have gone on to win the nomination even when a candidate is trailing in the national polls like sanders the leader has won 3 out of 5 times this includes candidates like democrat bill clinton in 1992 and republican mitt romney in 2012 biden though does significantly better in endorsements he has 33 endorsements from members of congress and governors dating back to 1980 endorsement leaders at this point also have a strong track record of winning primaries they ve gone on to win the nomination 10 of 14 times when a candidate like biden leads in the polls and endorsements they ve won 7 of 9 nominations interestingly there are nt a lot of primaries that are like the one we re currently in usually the candidate ahead in endorsements is the same candidate ahead in fundraising sanders appears ready in ways he never seemed comfortable with in his 2016 primary challenge to hillary clinton to draw real contrasts with his fellow democratic candidates in order to peel votes away from them sanders has clearly read up on biden s looooong voting record supported the invasion of iraq backed nafta advocated for a bankruptcy bill and is beginning to roll out the clear contrast between the former vice president s record on those issues and his own sanders is helped in all of this because he was in the senate contemporaneously with biden and can point to moments where the two differed the next question for sanders will be whether he puts these critiques in television ads in places like iowa and new hampshire as the votes in both of those states near some caution that in months of debates interviews and campaign appearances in the 2016 primary sen bernie sanders ivt was unable to take down hillary clinton by attacking her vote for the iraq war it is not clear that sanders will have any more luck taking down biden on iraq than he had taking down clinton four years later the issue may be even less potent than it once was the greater challenge to biden may come from former navy intelligence officer and former south bend ind mayor pete buttigieg who was too young to vote on the iraq war now comes across authoritative on national security and has the added benefit of being able to scold trump for using a bone spur deferment to get out of the vietnam war others note that sanders is the candidate best positioned to use the ramping up of hostilities in the middle east as an opportunity to highlight his alternative policy he s had a long record as an antiwar activist going back to the vietnam war in 2016 he gained some traction by contrasting his vote against the iraq war with hillary clinton s vote in favor in the current race sanders has staked out a radical foreign policy that includes ending the forever wars using aid money as leverage to push israel to negotiate with the palestinians and making climate change a cornerstone of american foreign policy the difficulty for sanders is that if he raises the salience of foreign policy he ll have to make an argument against not only trump but also barack obama the safer course for sanders would be to stick to domestic policy where his popular policies distinguish him enough that they could carry him to victory but trump s recklessness might make that safer path impossible the united states is already in a de facto war with iran if that war becomes a largescale conflict sanders will have no choice but to run as the only true antiwar candidate former president barack obama s top lieutenants are eager to poke every conceivable hole in bernie sanders resurgent bid for the democratic nomination but ask about a coordinated effort to stop his ascending campaign and you ll get crickets less than a month before voting begins obama has declined to offer a preferred pick to take on president trump in 2020 only occasionally waxing philosophical about the perils of moving too far left and reminding voters to be rooted in reality when exploring nominee options but as sanders gained new flashes of traction in recent weeks the former president s lack of official guidance to halt his momentum and the scattering of his inner circle to rival campaigns have hampered any meaningful neverbernie movement the most striking response to an ascendant sanders is the lack of one by declaring that the united states will respond with airstrikes to any attacks on american targets or assets mr trump is drawing a bright red line that iran can not cross and yet iran relies on a network of proxy actors from yemen syria iraq and lebanon must they all respect mr trump s red line there are plenty of hotheads in those proxy forces that will be incensed by the assassination the same way young men with weapons and minimal discipline often are mr trump can t keep an entire region from crossing his red line making violent conflict all the more likely if the president holds to it it is crucial that influential republican senators like lindsey graham marco rubio and mitch mcconnell remind mr trump of his promise to keep america out of foreign quagmires and keep mr trump from stumbling further into war with iran,The left believes sanders s chances have improved but notes that obstacles still remain. sanders reportedly pulled in about 345 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 which makes for a total sum of nearly 100 million no one else is even close.

robert mueller s russia report is coming thursday here s what you need to know the justice department says it plans to release special counsel robert mueller s report on thursday morning here s what you need to know mueller was appointed in the spring of 2017 to investigate whether president trump s campaign conspired with the russian interference in the 2016 election the fact of the interference itself had been long established and last month attorney general william barr told congress that mueller did not find that trump s campaign was involved with it barr also told congress that mueller did nt establish that trump broke the law in trying to frustrate the investigation but neither did mueller s office exonerate the president barr and deputy attorney general rod rosenstein concluded for themselves based on the special counsel s findings that trump would not face obstructionofjustice charges what the document is expected to reveal are the factual findings and legal analysis that underpinned the conclusions already shared by barr trump and republicans have welcomed barr s summary which they say vindicates the president and gave them a surge of momentum into the burgeoning 2020 election season democrats say they ca nt be sure barr is nt providing political cover for trump pointing to skepticism he voiced about mueller s inquiry before he was nominated to be attorney general trump s opponents say they ca nt be sure what to make of mueller s findings until they see the findings firsthand nearly 400 pages exclusive of tables and appendices barr told congress no barr told members of congress that he has been working with the special counsel s office to redact four kinds of information first grand jury material which is secret under the law second foreign intelligence that could compromise the sources and methods from which it originated which american spies want to protect third barr said he would redact information about ongoing cases or investigations those taking place elsewhere in the justice department now that the special counsel s work is complete charges unsealed last week against julian assange the founder of wikileaks and greg craig a former white house counsel made clear that legal aftershocks will continue even though the big political quake in washington apparently has passed and fourth barr told congress is information that implicates the privacy or reputational interests of peripheral third parties who were not charged the justice department should not reveal derogatory information about people whom it is nt accusing of breaking the law he said people in private life the attorney general told senators not public officeholders could barr try to protect political allies of the president it seems to me that s an exception you can just drive a truck through rep ed case dhawaii told barr last week trump s opponents accuse barr of working not as an independent arbiter but as a servant of the president democrats were furious for example when barr called the surveillance conducted of trump s campaign in 2016 spying after the russian government had launched its disinformation war on the presidential campaign house speaker nancy pelosi dcalif complained that barr was going off the rails and that she did nt trust him she ll trust only what she reads from mueller the fbi and justice department conducted surveillance of trump s campaign in 2016 as they investigated the election interference what republicans have charged since is that some officials may have abused their powers and violated the rights of at least one american law enforcement officials have denied that and defended their practices barr and key republicans in the senate including the chairman of the senate judiciary committee sen lindsey graham rsc say they want answers to questions about how and why decisions were made in 2016 barr told members of congress that another report is coming out this summer after the mueller report that could provide some answers about that question and barr has launched his own informal review about the origins of the russia investigation meaning that this saga may continue to be not only about what trump and his camp did but about what investigators and justice department officials did too why for example did nt officials brief trump s campaign in 2016 about the contacts they were discovering between people in his camp and russians how did the fbi use confidential informants in trying to discover what trump s campaign was doing one topic it might explore is what trump and his top lieutenants in 2016 knew and when barr said that mueller did nt establish that trump s campaign conspired with the russians but did trump himself ever get word about the offers of help that were coming in from russians or their agents including those to his son donald trump jr if so did trump believe them and actively decide not to accept what was being offered or did trump just ignore them altogether americans have learned a lot from mueller s office about the methods by which russia interfered in the election the bestknown schemes include agitation on social media aimed at amplifying disagreements among americans and the cyberattacks that stole data that was then released to embarrass political targets others schemes that have nt received as much attention have been established too will mueller s report uncover any other types of interference that have nt yet been made public barr and rosenstein said they ve concluded that trump wo nt face obstructionofjustice charges what did investigators uncover about what actions he took how close was the call for the leaders of the justice department where did mueller come down on all this what recommendations did he make if any about charges for trump did he defer that to the leaders of the justice department or did he intend for conclusions about his findings and analysis to be reached by members of congress barr says to expect some insights about all this the report sets forth the special counsel s findings his analysis and the reasons for his conclusions the attorney general wrote to congress barr s letters about the work of the special counsel investigation have taken the wind from the sails of democrats who had been pushing for impeachment proceedings against trump members of congress could resume that battle however if mueller s raw findings lead trump s opponents to conclude he acted wrongly or abused his office separate from mueller s or barr s reading of relevant criminal law all these questions legal wrangling redactions will this report make sense are we going to get the gist of this or is it going to be you know reading a section on january 2015 and then you have to flip 15 pages to find the next text schatz asked barr said the justice department would do better than that, robert mueller was appointed in the spring of 2017 to investigate whether president trump s campaign conspired with the russian interference in the 2016 election. The document is expected to reveal are the factual findings and legal analysis that underpinned the conclusions reached by mueller.  republicans have welcomed barr s summary which they say vindicates the president and gave them a surge of momentum. democrats say they ca nt be sure barr is nt providing political cover for trump pointing to skepticism he voiced about mueller s inquiry. Barr told congress is information that implicates the privacy or reputational interests of peripheral third parties who were not charged. The justice department should not reveal derogatory information about people whom it is nt accusing of breaking the law he said people in private life. The fbi and justice department conducted surveillance of trump s campaign in 2016 as they investigated the election interference. republicans have charged since is that some officials may have abused their powers and violated the rights of at least one American law enforcement officials have denied that and defended their practices. The saga may continue to be not only about what trump and his camp did but about what investigators and justice department officials did too. Why did the fbi use confidential informants in trying to discover what trump s campaign was doing. Did trump believe them and actively decide not to accept what was being offered or did trump just ignore them altogether. Barr and rosenstein said they ve concluded that trump wo nt face obstructionofjustice charges. What did investigators uncover about what actions he took how close was the call for the leaders of the justice department where did mueller come down on all this.  work of the special counsel investigation have taken the wind from the sails of democrats who had been pushing for impeachment proceedings against trump members of congress. If mueller s raw findings lead trump s opponents to conclude he acted wrongly or abused his office separate from mueller's or barr s reading of relevant criminal law all these questions legal wrangling redactions will this report make sense.
the air always swirls with popular myths that when repeated constantly are taken by some to be indisputably true one such myth today is that president donald trump is unique among presidents in standing up firmly to the chinese and other foreigners to stop them from harming us economically with their import restrictions export subsidies and illegal immigration according to that theory the tariffs he uses to counter these foreign practices are to our benefit as such we should purportedly welcome them with gratitude trump is indeed unique among modern presidents in his eagerness to use tariffs but his vaunted toughness in using them is nothing for us americans to applaud we should instead condemn their use trump s socalled standing up to foreigners is more like stomping on americans freedom and prosperity the fundamental reality most people forget is that when foreign governments artificially make their exports to the united states more abundant and less expensive we re the winners we americans reap the gains foreign consumers and taxpayers are the poor souls who predominantly suffer the burden while some us producers admittedly suffer from this competition the truth is that when trump bargains hard to stop other governments from subsidizing their exports he inflicts more harm on his fellow americans overall in the form of higher prices and reduced supplies if successful his bargaining may actually help foreign consumers and american taxpayers unfortunately it s more likely that foreign governments wo nt cave and may instead retaliate then we ll all end up with higher tariffs each tariff trump imposes is a tax on americans this is true regardless of why he claims he does it it s true when he wants to protect his friends in the steel industry against foreign competition it s true when he does it in the name of telling the chinese government how to rule china or not to steal our intellectual property it s true when he uses tariffs to force the mexican government to stop immigrants from entering mexico through its southern bordersomething he fails to do for the united states and it s true when he uses tariffs as leverage to get a better trade deal with canada and mexico or with the europeans leaving aside for now the fact that this has failed repeatedly as a strategy to force countries into making concessions they were nt willing to make in the first place we must face the truth that these tariffs are a penalty trump forces on those of us who choose to buy imports this is obvious to anyone who reads through the comments submitted to the office of the us trade representative on proposed new duties on americans who import from china you ll read heartbreaking stories like this we are concerned that this tariff could single handedly reverse over half a century struggling through the journey to support our large family and our many loyal employees or this margins in our sector are already very thin and the proposed incremental duty would result in us shutting down the business these duties that our selfproclaimed tariff man president is so proud of will have longlasting consequencesnone of which are good american natural gas companies selling in china for instance have not only seen their market diminish steadily since the beginning of the trade war but it s now at risk of disappearing completely if trade negotiations collapse farmers obviously have taken a serious hit thanks to multifront trade warsa hit that the president attempts to soften with billions of dollars in subsidies paid for through higher taxes on other americans automakers have operated in a state of uncertainty not knowing when the next large tax hikes on auto parts or automobiles will materialize they also live with the uncertainty of whether and when they may be subjected to stricter and counterproductive rules of origin through the new nafta on the other hand if you define standing up for americans as imposing a massive tax increase on us then yes the president is indeed standing up for us according to bryan riley at the national taxpayers union the potential 2019 inflationadjusted tax burden of the trump tariffs at our current import level is the biggest tax increase americans have been subjected to since world war ii maybe it s time for the president to take a seat,The myth that president donald trump is unique among presidents in his eagerness to use tariffs is nothing for us americans to applaud we should instead condemn their use. When foreign governments artificially make their exports to the united states more abundant and less expensive we re the winners we americans reap the gains. When trump bargains hard to stop other governments from subsidizing their exports he inflicts more harm on his fellow americans overall in the form of higher prices and reduced supplies. oreign consumers and taxpayers are the poor souls who predominantly suffer the burden. Tariffs have failed repeatedly as a strategy to force countries into making concessions they were nt willing to make in the first place. These tariffs are a penalty trump forces on those of us who choose to buy imports. Farmers have taken a serious hit thanks to multifront trade warsa hit that the president attempts to soften with billions of dollars in subsidies paid for through higher taxes on other americans automakers have operated in a state of uncertainty not knowing when the next large tax hikes on auto parts or automobiles will materialize. The tax burden of the trump tariffs at our current import level is the biggest tax increase americans have been subjected to since world war ii maybe it s time for the president to take a seat.

the obama administration is being accused of giving labor groups special treatment under the law after formally proposing a change that could exempt union health plans from a pesky obamacare fee sen john thune rsd who flagged the obscure rule change after it was filed in the federal register see page 70 blasted the exemption as crony capitalism at its worst unions are now experiencing the ugly reality of this law and they want out he said in a statement indeed the aflcio has fought against what is known as the reinsurance fee in the affordable care act the temporary fee would kick in next year and is meant to raise 25 billion over three years to help pay for the cost of people with preexisting conditions signing up for coverage through the obamacare exchanges the proposal filed monday would exempt certain selfinsured plans those that do not use a thirdparty administrator for core functions for 2015 and 2016 republicans charge this is aimed at unions socalled tafthartley plans though union officials had downplayed the change and suggested some of their plans would nt be eligible anyway aflcio president richard trumka said earlier this month when the administration first telegraphed that it might craft the exemption that the change does not single out the union insurance policies according to the associated press a health and human services official also disputed the claim that this is directed at unions this definition would exempt any selfinsured group health plan that does not use a third party administrator for claims processing or enrollment not only union plans the official told foxnewscom adding they are proposing the change to better align the definition with the law the phrase selfinsured selfadministered plans is not synonymous with multiemployer plans or tafthartley plans but republicans say the change is clearly aimed at unions particularly after labor leaders made a highprofile push to extract some relief from the health care law trumka and other labor leaders met with president obama and vice president biden at the white house in september as part of a bid to win additional health care subsidies for their workers the administration determined it could not give them any more subsidies but later made clear it would look at providing relief from the socalled reinsurance fee the fee would start at 63 per person next year but then drop to a bit more than 40 per person in 2015 it would drop again the following year the proposed change would not provide any exemption in 2014 thune and a dozen other senators are pushing a bill to bar the administration from exempting unions thune s office said that the senator is concerned the exemptions in 2015 and 2016 will end up forcing other selfinsured plans to pay more the proposal in the federal register appeared to signal this possibility the proposal said that the department of health and human services decided not to make any changes for 2014 because it would mean rates would have to be raised for other contributing entities asked for clarification on how the change would affect other plans rates and fees for 2015 and 2016 the hhs official said it is true that the fee will be higher for plans that do have to pay the fee in 2015 because some plans are exempt,Proposal would exempt certain selfinsured plans those that do not use a thirdparty administrator for core functions for 2015 and 2016. republicans charge this is aimed at unions socalled tafthartley plans. A health and human services official disputed the claim that this is directed at unions this definition would exempt any selfinsured group health plan that does not use a third party administrator for claims processing or enrollment not only union plans. The fee would start at 63 per person next year but then drop to a bit more than 40 per person in 2015 it would drop again the following year. The proposed change would not provide any exemption in 2014 thune and a dozen other senators are pushing a bill to bar the administration from exempting unions. The fee will be higher for plans that do have to pay the fee in 2015 because some plans are exempt. uld affect other plans rates and fees for 2015 and 2016 the hhs official said.

lengthy response that essentially said the united states would determine how to proceed at its own pace what we do nt believe is necessary is to hastily reach a determination when the right course of action in our view is to review this in a deliberate manner to consult with congress to review our obligations under the law and to in the meantime encourage the authorities in egypt to hasten a

the weekly standard shut down on friday after 23 years of publication in an unceremonious execution mediadc the magazine s owner instructed staff to clear out their desks by the end of the day according to cofounder john podhoretz mediadc chose to kill the outlet so it could stripmine its assets and subscriber list the shuttering of the flagship conservative publication is a deeply unfortunate development in an era when rightleaning media is increasingly obsequious toward donald trump and hesitant to criticize his abuses of power no critic of the president should cheer the weekly standard s demise to many progressives friday s news may seem to be just desserts for a magazine that has long espoused what the left views as noxious policy proposals and there is no doubt that the weekly standard has published more than its share of dubious specious and offensive articles the magazine was closely aligned with the george w bush administration and notoriously vigorously promoted the catastrophic war in iraq its lgbtq coverage is reliably atrociousrecall this 2009 classic titled the worst thing about gay marriage which claims without evidence that the most profound aspect of marriage is protecting and controlling the sexuality of the childbearing sex i could go on the magazine is vehemently antiabortion and antitrans pushing offensive falsehoods to mock and degrade transgender people it has asserted that gay people like me who sought the right to marry will demand polyamory next writers routinely peddle climate change skepticism and denialism these articles are dangerous and irresponsible there is obviously much to criticize here and i do not expect liberals to praise a magazine that has derided their beliefs for more than two decades but there is still nothing to celebrate about its untimely death over the last few years the weekly standard has emerged as one of the very few conservative outlets to resist trumpism to defend a vision of conservatism that rejects trump s lawlessness his authoritarian impulses and his grotesque embrace of white nationalism even if the never trump movement represents a small segment of the republican party it remains an important counter to the broader opportunistic conservative embrace of the president and the weekly standard s dissolution will only encourage other rightwing outlets to publish more irresponsible protrump garbage that is not to say that every other conservative publication has entirely jettisoned its principles to defend trump if you re interested in a reasonable take on say the robert mueller investigation or trump s trade wars you can read david french in national review or gabriel malor in the federalist but these voices are ever rarer and lonelier as i write the top story on national review is an absurd defense of michael cohen s crimes which argues that prosecutors are twisting campaignfinance law to secure his conviction its purpose is not to defend cohen himself but the criminal acts to which he has confessed and in which he has implicated trump the federalist has posted a similar article as well as a dark warning that the fbi is hiding the truth about michael flynn replete with a baseless intimation that mueller s team might be destroying documents that could exonerate flynn the federalist appears to be the new model for conservative media a truly depressing development given its almost unrelenting dishonesty in may the week s damon linker wrote a devastating critique of the magazine s many lies about the fbi the federalist linker wrote is a leading disseminator of protrump conspiracies and upisdown funhousemirror distortions of special counsel robert mueller s investigation into russian election meddling and potential trump involvement if anything that s an understatement the federalist led the push to fire deputy attorney general rod rosenstein who long oversaw the probe it has claimed over and over again that mueller is leading a partisan witch hunt its authors have decried his obsessive pursuit of the president and condemned mueller as the clown prince of federal law enforcement at every turn the federalist seeks to reinforce trump s claim that the mueller probe is illegitimate if not illegal the weekly standard by contrast has remained profoundly skeptical toward trump click over to national review and you ll find a more mixed bag french for instance writes eloquently and accurately about the investigation and its achievements but his work is countered by andrew mccarthy a fantasist who describes rosenstein as a weasel declared that mueller stacked his staff with partisans wrote that paul manafort s conviction was good news for president trump claimed mueller set up trump for a perjury trap and indicated that the fbi is corrupt mccarthy also champions the narrative that the steele dossier was the driving force behind the trumprussia investigation which is false there are plenty more examples byron york at the washington examiner humiliates himself by lying to help trump and spreading conspiracy theories about the fbi kimberley strassel a member of the wall street journal s editorial board writes toxic protrump nonsense that sometimes contradicts the paper s excellent reporting i am sure that there are reasonable people at the examiner and the journal who are embarrassed by this drivel and wish their outlet did not publish it but publish they do aiding trump s effort to assault the integrity of mueller rosenstein and the fbi the weekly standard by contrast has remained profoundly skeptical toward trump its reporting on the latest developments in the russia probe are truthful and perceptive one of its very last articles published friday celebrates trump s inability to impede the investigation there are exceptionsits executive editor fred barnes has penned some very silly criticisms of the special counsel but the magazine has not slipped into the federalist s fever dream it does not often carry water for the president and does not hesitate to condemn his dumbest ideas the weekly standard is in short a conservative magazine rooted in reality those are now in short supply and while it is apparently untrue that the weekly standard bled readers because of its never trump stanceits web traffic has reportedly increasedother conservative outlets may view its death as a warning stray too far from the trump party line and readers will abandon you we will see more writers like byron york and kimberley strassel and fewer like weekly standard star haley byrd one of the finest congressional reporters working today it is healthy to have a magazine that challenges both democrats and republicans in good faitha conservative outlet that progressives can not simply write off as an asinine protrump propaganda machine and it is encouraging to know that the entire conservative movement has not latched itself to trump s cult of personality american conservatism will always be with us but trump will not what happens after he is gone will the republican party indefinitely adopt his cruelty his knownothingism his contempt for the law or will a saner faction assert dominance in the gop the weekly standard made me optimistic for the latter possibility its demise suggests that the trumpists will win out,"The weekly standard

washington cnn the supreme court appeared closely divided along ideological lines during oral arguments monday in a case that could determine president barack obama s legacy on immigration conservative justices questioned obama s authority to use executive actions to shield some 4 million undocumented immigrants from deportation chief justice john roberts and justice samuel alito seemed particularly concerned with language in the administration s guidance that said the program s recipients would be lawfully present which they suggested would contradict immigration law how is it possible to lawfully work in the united states without lawfully being in the united states alito asked roberts added i mean they re lawfully present and yet they re present in violation of the law liberals on the bench seemed sympathetic to the administration s arguments justice ruth bader ginsburg noted at one point that there are 113 million undocumented aliens in the country and congress has provided funds for removing about 4 million so inevitably priorities have to be set she said justice sonia sotomayor said there are not enough resources to deport everyone they are here whether we want them or not she said obama announced the moves to great fanfare in late 2014 as a response to congressional inaction on immigration reform but a federal court blocked them after texas and 25 other states sued busloads of immigrants rights activists some of them undocumented appeared on the court s plaza to support the policies the moves are meant to shield them from deportation and allow them work permits nancy garcia a us citizen from milwaukee who was protesting with the wisconsin group voces de la frontera voices from the border said she became active on the issue after wisconsin lawmakers tried to crack down on undocumented immigrants we re not drug lords we re not rapists we re good people garcia said tea party patriots member gregg cummings said he arrived at 6 am to find a spot in front of the court to protest the executive actions cummings from lamoni iowa said he is concerned about the prospect of obama s supreme court nominee judge merrick garland changing the ideological balance of the court our number one purpose of being here is supporting the senators better standing strong on no votes on the new supreme court justice he said critics of obama s moves say they are part of a pattern of the white house looking to go around the republican congress basically the president has stepped in and taken over what normally would be associated with congress texas attorney general ken paxton said in an interview congress makes the laws roberts also seemed concerned with the scope of the government s argument defending obama s moves under your argument could the president grant deferred removal to every unlawful unlawfully present alien in the united states right now he asked solicitor general donald verrilli at one point justice anthony kennedy suggested that the president might have strayed into congress territory it s as if that the president is setting the policy and congress is executing it he said that s just upside down the gop congress was involved at oral arguments as well the house of representatives in an unusual move intervened in the case against the administration and had 15 minutes before the eight justices that only eight justices are hearing the case due to the death in february of justice antonin scalia could impact the final result a split court between the four democraticappointed justices and four gopappointed justices would mean the programs remain blocked and the case is sent back to the district court in texas that blocked them in the first place for the administration a key argument before the court is to say that the states do not have the legal right to bring the case in the first place if it can convince a majority of justices on that issue the court may not even get to the merits of the immigration debate all eyes were on roberts who has in past cases sometimes limited who can bring challenges to court on monday he asked some critical questions of the government s position but it was unclear how interested he might be in dismissing the case on standing the question is does texas have the right to bring this case said cnn senior legal analyst jeffrey toobin texas says if you give legal status to these people then we ll have to give them drivers licenses the federal government says there s nothing in this law about drivers licenses this law is directed entirely at the immigrants themselves it does not impose any obligations on the states so the states should not have the right to challenge it that s the standing argument i think the obama administration thinks they have a better chance at winning over one of the conservatives on standing than they do on the merits of the case elizabeth wydra president of the constitutional accountability center who filed a brief in support of the government says she would nt write off the chief justice on the merits of the case or on the issue of standing on the merits chief justice roberts concerns seemed to be alleviated when the solicitor general clarified that undocumented immigrantsgiven relief under the programs are simply afforded deferred action but none the less are subject to removal proceedings at any time the executive changes its enforcement priorities she said should it win on that count the injunction would be lifted and the programs would be able to go into effect during the final months of the obama presidency however because the actions can be changed or reversed by the next president immigrants would have to decide whether to come forward for the remaining months of the obama administration or risk doing so with the possibility of donald trump or ted cruz in the white house there s no question that the ultimate fate of the deferred action policy hangs in the balance of the upcoming election said stephen i vladeck a professor of law at american university and cnn legal analyst like any other executive order it can be modified rescinded or expanded by the next president and codified or overruled by the next congress vladeck added but the fact that the supreme court expedited its consideration of the obama administration s appeal so that it could resolve the dispute by june suggests that even shorthanded the justices want to have their own say first the white house announced the programs in november 2014 issuing a fivepage guidance memo enabling qualifying undocumented workers to receive temporary relief from the threat of deportation and to apply for programs that could qualify them for work authorization and associated benefits the deferred action for parents of americans and lawful permanent residents dapa targets the nearly 43 million undocumented parents of citizens and lawful residents and the second rule expands deferred action for childhood arrivals daca initiative aimed at non citizens who came to the country as children we ll bring more undocumented immigrants out of the shadows so they can play by the rules pay their full share of taxes pass a criminal background check and get right with the law obama told an audience in nevada after the programs were announced the programs remain frozen nationwide they were first blocked by a federal judge in texas and a divided federal appeals court later upheld the preliminary injunction obama s lawyers argue in court papers that the lower court rulings threatened great harm not only to the proper role of federal courts and to federal immigration law but also to millions of parents of us citizens and permanent residents aliens who are the lowest priorities for removal yet now work off the books to support their families as a threshold issue verrilli says that the states do nt have the legal right to be in court because the constitution assigns the formation of immigration policy exclusively to the national government precisely because immigration is an inherently national matter he stressed that the guidance from the government does not provide any kind of lawful status under immigration law as the aliens remain removable at any time immigrant communities fought for these programs said marielena hincapié the executive director of the national immigration law center she says that her groups have been informing people about the risks of the rules being changed by the next president and she believes many will come forward should the obama administration win texas solicitor general scott keller argues that the states have standing to bring the challenge in part because dapa would create a new class of recipients for state subsidized driver s licenses in texas he says that texas would stand to lose millions of dollars if even a small fraction of dapa eligible aliens applied dapa is an extraordinary assertion of executive power keller wrote in court papers the executive has unilaterally crafted an enormous program one of the largest changes ever to our nation s approach to immigration he said in doing so the executive dispensed with immigration statutes by declaring unlawful conduct to be lawful he points to the guidance and says that the eligible undocumented immigrations would be permitted to be lawfully present in the united states which would make them eligible for work authorization and some types of social security and medicare benefits texas is supported by the gopled house of representatives who say that the programs went forward after the president failed in his attempts to persuade congress to revise immigration laws erin e murphy a lawyer for the house called the administration s position the most aggressive of executive power claims andrew pincus a lawyer who supports the administration s position says that allowing texas to bring the case would have broad implications if a state can sue every time the federal government does something to increase the state s costs states could sue to challenge almost anything the federal government does he said pincus points out that texas is not objecting to the administration s use of prosecutorial discretion it just does nt want the undocumented workers to be able to work legally you are saying to these people you can stay here but we are keeping you in a bubble he said," conservative justices questioned obama s authority to use executive actions to shield some 4 million undocumented immigrants from deportation chief justice john roberts and justice samuel alito seemed particularly concerned with language in the administration s guidance that said the program s recipients would be lawfully present which they suggested would contradict immigration
