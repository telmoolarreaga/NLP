Yet , when we talk about \\u2018 Americans \\u2019 in the United States , we \\u2019 re usually just referring to people from the United States . This erases other cultures and depicts the United States as the dominant American country . \\u201d\\nThe conclusion in that draft was to replace \\u201c America \\u201d and \\u201c American \\u201d with \\u201c U.S . citizen \\u201d or \\u201c person from the U.S . \\u201d\\nYou can \\u2019 t make this stuff up .

Within his statement , he said , \\u201c We consider free speech and the First Amendment the foundations of a great American public university. \\u201d Sounds nice , but how did America and American make the list in the first place ?\\n\\u201c What this document is : This is a living resource compiled by the Inclusive Communications Task Force at Colorado State University . The document is intended to serve as a best practices guide . It is provided and will be updated with the intention of sharing meaningful and useful language suggestions . It is worth noting that language is always evolving so this document will be updated periodically .\\n\\u201c What this document is not : This is not an official policy or required practice . This document is intended as a resource to help our campus community reflect our Principles of Community particularly inclusion , respect , and social justice .\\n\\u201c The language in the guide may not apply to every individual and it is critical to take personal preference into account . The guide is not about political-correctness or policing grammar , but rather helping communicators practice inclusive language and helping everyone on our campus feel welcomed , respected , and valued . \\u201d\\nInstead of spending so much time worrying about ways not to offend anyone , it would be nice if our colleges and universities actually worried about teaching our students . Since 1978 , college tuition has gone up 1,125 percent - four times the rate of inflation , while actual time in the classroom by tenured professors teaching undergraduates has gone down .\\nWhile we \\u2019 re at it , It would be nice if the staff at our colleges and universities focused on ways to teach our students objective American history , basic economics and financial literacy . It seems that too many of the left-wing college professors and administrators have led large numbers of our young people to believe that America is a land of inequality ( if they even say America anymore ) , capitalism is unjust and their generation is getting a raw deal .\\nIronically , the opposite is true . No generation in human history has ever experienced a world with more prosperity , more freedom , more leisure time , more access to information , higher literacy rates , better life expectancy , lower child mortality , less poverty , less disease , less hunger and less violent crime that the current generation .\\nIt is part of the reason I am so excited to be the president-elect of Young America \\u2019 s Foundation .

People still come from all over the world to seek the freedom and prosperity found only in America .\\nPart of the greatness of our United States is that anyone can claim that freedom and prosperity . It doesn \\u2019 t matter what class you were born into , what your parents did for a living , where you live or what you look like ; everyone of us is created equal . As the U.S. Constitution says , endowed by our Creator with certain unalienable Rights , that among these are Life , Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness .\\nWhat we do with those blessings is up to each of us .

''\\nTempers boiled over as the House Foreign Affairs Committee held a hearing with several analysts , though none would be considered key figures in the administration 's Benghazi attack response . A few officials with inside knowledge were briefing select lawmakers behind closed doors Thursday ; and in a win for lawmakers , Foreign Affairs Committee Chairwoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen , R-Fla. , announced that Secretary of State Hillary Clinton will testify next month .\\nBut the House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing swiftly became a venue for lawmakers to voice their frustrations and lob accusations at the administration . Lawmakers sparred early and often , with Democrats accusing Republicans of turning a tragedy into a `` political football '' and Republicans accusing the administration of hiding the truth .\\n`` This administration has lied to the American people about this tragedy , '' Rep. Dana Rohrabacher , R-Calif. , said . `` The arrogance and dishonesty in all of this is breathtaking . Let 's not stonewall this issue and cover up mistakes , which seems to be what is going on today . ''\\nLawmakers continue to express concerns on several fronts -- on whether warnings in the months preceding Sept. 11 were ignored , and on why the administration first insisted the attack was a `` spontaneous '' act .\\nRep. Ed Royce , R-Calif. , also suggested the U.S. was ill-prepared for the threat posed in eastern Libya on the anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks . `` Somebody forgot to circle the calendar on 9/11 , '' he said .\\nWhile lawmakers sparred on the House Foreign Affairs Committee , the House and Senate intelligence committees were both holding closed oversight hearings Thursday where a roster of top-ranking intelligence and other officials were set to testify . These include Director of National Intelligence James Clapper and CIA Acting Director Michael Morell , who was tapped to replace David Petraeus after he resigned last Friday .\\nPetraeus , though , has agreed to speak to the intelligence committees about Libya , with back-to-back appearances before the House and Senate panels scheduled for Friday morning . Those , too , will be closed to the public .\\nWhile the round of closed hearings is a start , other lawmakers are calling for a more robust inquiry into what happened before , during and after the Sept. 11 attack in Benghazi which left four Americans dead .\\nSen. John McCain , R-Ariz. , and two other Republican colleagues on Wednesday called for the creation of a `` select committee '' to investigate Benghazi .\\n`` Let me be clear : There is no credibility among most of us concerning the administration and the numerous controversies and contradictions that have been involved in their handling of this issue , '' McCain said , at a lengthy news conference on Capitol Hill .\\nMcCain was joined by Sens . Lindsey Graham , R-S.C. , and Kelly Ayotte , R-N.H. , in calling for a temporary Senate committee established specifically to investigate Libya . Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid later said he would not support their proposal .\\nThough the administration has urged lawmakers to wait until an internal review is completed , lawmakers have raised a litany of questions about the attack .\\nThe latest dispute centers on U.S . Ambassador to the U.N. Susan Rice , who repeatedly said the attack was spontaneous on five Sunday shows after the attack despite other officials preparing to call it terrorism . Obama , in his first post-election press conference Wednesday , called the criticism `` outrageous '' and told those lawmakers to `` go after me . ''\\nGraham responded : `` Mr President , do n't think for one minute I do n't hold you ultimately responsible for Benghazi . I think you failed as commander in chief before , during and after the attack . ''\\nThough Petraeus is embroiled in a scandal over an extramarital affair -- which led to his resignation -- he is not expected to address that when he speaks to lawmakers Friday . Rather , he will stick to Libya .\\nLawmakers want to know , among other things , about a trip Petraeus took to Libya the week of Oct. 31 . They are curious about a report that was put together summarizing his meetings and which may include details of his personal interviews with the CIA station chief in Benghazi about the attack . A State Department consulate , as well as a CIA annex , came under heavy fire that night .\",\n          \"Trump Steps In To Help Oil Industry Facing Its Own Coronavirus Crisis\\nOil prices bounced back a bit after President Trump said the Department of Energy would buy crude for the nation 's strategic petroleum reserve .\\n`` We 're going to fill it right to the top , '' Trump said Friday in a wide-ranging news conference at the White House . He said it will save taxpayers `` billions and billions of dollars '' while helping an industry that 's been reeling .\\nWhile oil prices increased nearly 5 % after Friday 's announcement , that was just a fraction of the amount they lost earlier in the week .\\nIn South Texas , Rudy Martinez immediately experienced the effects of the past week 's collapse in crude oil prices .\\n`` I actually have a little man camp and these guys are on the way out because they lost contracts , '' says Martinez , who has eight rooms he rents to out-of-town oilfield workers in Karnes City , Texas .\\n`` The workers get their per-diem and I charge them $ 100 a person [ per week ] . Actually I 'd like to charge them a little more than that , but now that it 's tapered off , it 's hard to charge them that because they ca n't pay it , '' he says .\\nBack when the oil business was really booming in Karnes City , Martinez says he could charge up to $ 2000 a week per person .\\nThis is one small example of what declining oil prices mean for the rural communities that depend on the oil business . And there 's a lot at stake for the U.S. , the world 's largest producer of crude oil .\\nOil prices had been falling out of fears the coronavirus epidemic threatened world economic growth . Demand was also down as large gatherings were canceled and people started staying home to avoid getting sick .\\nThen prices plunged after Saudi Arabia and Russia failed to agree on production cuts and instead entered a price war last Sunday . In a stunning reversal , Saudi Arabia said it would actually boost oil production and offer a massive discount for its customers .\\nU.S. oil companies , especially smaller ones , are now looking to make deep cuts . Industry analysts warn of possible bankruptcies , especially if oil remains where it 's fallen to , in the $ 30 per barrel range . Companies operating in Texas 's Eagle Ford Shale need prices between $ 40 to $ 60 a barrel to remain profitable .\\nKarnes City was transformed by the oil drilling boom that started about a decade back . Karnes County National Bank President Trip Ruckman says there were local farmers and ranchers who were just getting by , then all of a sudden showed up at his bank with a $ 1 million oil royalty check in hand .\\nRight now it can still look pretty busy around town . There are trucks on the roads and a few local hotels are still full . Ruckman says it takes time for drillers to wind down production plans that already were being implemented when prices collapsed .\\n`` Probably , in a few weeks to a month or two , I think you 're going to see things slow down . But we 'll still be here \\u2014 we were here before the oil , '' says Ruckman , who tries to stay optimistic about the financial future of his community .\\nThere have been reports the Trump administration may be willing to help the oil industry in other ways . For example , the White House could reduce federal royalties for oil pumped on government land or offshore . The administration could also offer low-interest government-backed loans .\\n`` The last people who deserve taxpayers ' money are the billionaires that created and profited from the climate crisis , '' says Jack Shapiro of the environmental group Greenpeace .\\nOne potential bright spot in all this is gasoline prices . Lower oil prices will mean cheaper gas for motorists in coming months .\\nUsually when gas prices go down people drive more and choose bigger cars , which increases consumption . But with many limiting travel out of concern over the coronavirus , this time might be the exception .\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"content_original\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"ANALYSIS/OPINION:\\n\\nAmerica and American are offensive.\\n\\nThis is not my view.

Within his statement, he said, \\u201cWe consider free speech and the First Amendment the foundations of a great American public university.\\u201d Sounds nice, but how did America and American make the list in the first place?\\n\\nHere is the introductory language in the original document:\\n\\n\\u201cInclusive Language Guide\\n\\n\\u201cLiving Document \\u2014 Updates made frequently\\n\\n\\u201cWhat this document is: This is a living resource compiled by the Inclusive Communications Task Force at Colorado State University. The document is intended to serve as a best practices guide. It is provided and will be updated with the intention of sharing meaningful and useful language suggestions. It is worth noting that language is always evolving so this document will be updated periodically.\\n\\n\\u201cWhat this document is not: This is not an official policy or required practice. This document is intended as a resource to help our campus community reflect our Principles of Community particularly inclusion, respect, and social justice.\\n\\n\\u201cThe language in the guide may not apply to every individual and it is critical to take personal preference into account. The guide is not about political-correctness or policing grammar, but rather helping communicators practice inclusive language and helping everyone on our campus feel welcomed, respected, and valued.\\u201d\\n\\nInstead of spending so much time worrying about ways not to offend anyone, it would be nice if our colleges and universities actually worried about teaching our students. Since 1978, college tuition has gone up 1,125 percent - four times the rate of inflation, while actual time in the classroom by tenured professors teaching undergraduates has gone down.\\n\\nWhile we\\u2019re at it, It would be nice if the staff at our colleges and universities focused on ways to teach our students objective American history, basic economics and financial literacy. It seems that too many of the left-wing college professors and administrators have led large numbers of our young people to believe that America is a land of inequality (if they even say America anymore), capitalism is unjust and their generation is getting a raw deal.\\n\\nIronically, the opposite is true. No generation in human history has ever experienced a world with more prosperity, more freedom, more leisure time, more access to information, higher literacy rates, better life expectancy, lower child mortality, less poverty, less disease, less hunger and less violent crime that the current generation.\\n\\nIt is part of the reason I am so excited to be the president-elect of Young America\\u2019s Foundation. We have the truth on our side. We just need to get it out to our young Americans.\\n\\nBut it will not be easy. Even though the words \\u201cAmerica\\u201d and \\u201cAmerican\\u201d were not included in the latest version of the Inclusive Communications Task Force document, the fact that they even made an earlier draft \\u2014 and the reasoning behind it \\u2014 should wake us all up to the tremendous bias (intentional or not) on our campuses.\\n\\nThe motto of our nation is E pluribus unum (Out of many, One). People still come from all over the world to seek the freedom and prosperity found only in America.\\n\\nPart of the greatness of our United States is that anyone can claim that freedom and prosperity. It doesn\\u2019t matter what class you were born into, what your parents did for a living, where you live or what you look like; everyone of us is created equal. As the U.S. Constitution says, endowed by our Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness.\\n\\nWhat we do with those blessings is up to each of us. And that, is part of what makes me proud to be an American.\\n\\n\\u2022 Scott Walker was the 45th governor of Wisconsin.

A few officials with inside knowledge were briefing select lawmakers behind closed doors Thursday; and in a win for lawmakers, Foreign Affairs Committee Chairwoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R-Fla., announced that Secretary of State Hillary Clinton will testify next month.\\n\\nBut the House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing swiftly became a venue for lawmakers to voice their frustrations and lob accusations at the administration. Lawmakers sparred early and often, with Democrats accusing Republicans of turning a tragedy into a \\\"political football\\\" and Republicans accusing the administration of hiding the truth.\\n\\n\\\"This administration has lied to the American people about this tragedy,\\\" Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, R-Calif., said. \\\"The arrogance and dishonesty in all of this is breathtaking. Let's not stonewall this issue and cover up mistakes, which seems to be what is going on today.\\\"\\n\\nLawmakers continue to express concerns on several fronts -- on whether warnings in the months preceding Sept. 11 were ignored, and on why the administration first insisted the attack was a \\\"spontaneous\\\" act.\\n\\nRep. Ed Royce, R-Calif., also suggested the U.S. was ill-prepared for the threat posed in eastern Libya on the anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks. \\\"Somebody forgot to circle the calendar on 9/11,\\\" he said.\\n\\nWhile lawmakers sparred on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, the House and Senate intelligence committees were both holding closed oversight hearings Thursday where a roster of top-ranking intelligence and other officials were set to testify. These include Director of National Intelligence James Clapper and CIA Acting Director Michael Morell, who was tapped to replace David Petraeus after he resigned last Friday.\\n\\nPetraeus, though, has agreed to speak to the intelligence committees about Libya, with back-to-back appearances before the House and Senate panels scheduled for Friday morning. Those, too, will be closed to the public.\\n\\nWhile the round of closed hearings is a start, other lawmakers are calling for a more robust inquiry into what happened before, during and after the Sept. 11 attack in Benghazi which left four Americans dead.\\n\\nSen. John McCain, R-Ariz., and two other Republican colleagues on Wednesday called for the creation of a \\\"select committee\\\" to investigate Benghazi.\\n\\n\\\"Let me be clear: There is no credibility among most of us concerning the administration and the numerous controversies and contradictions that have been involved in their handling of this issue,\\\" McCain said, at a lengthy news conference on Capitol Hill.\\n\\nMcCain was joined by Sens. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., and Kelly Ayotte, R-N.H., in calling for a temporary Senate committee established specifically to investigate Libya. Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid later said he would not support their proposal.\\n\\nThough the administration has urged lawmakers to wait until an internal review is completed, lawmakers have raised a litany of questions about the attack.\\n\\nThe latest dispute centers on U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Susan Rice, who repeatedly said the attack was spontaneous on five Sunday shows after the attack despite other officials preparing to call it terrorism. Obama, in his first post-election press conference Wednesday, called the criticism \\\"outrageous\\\" and told those lawmakers to \\\"go after me.\\\"\\n\\nGraham responded: \\\"Mr President, don't think for one minute I don't hold you ultimately responsible for Benghazi. I think you failed as commander in chief before, during and after the attack.\\\"\\n\\nThough Petraeus is embroiled in a scandal over an extramarital affair -- which led to his resignation -- he is not expected to address that when he speaks to lawmakers Friday. Rather, he will stick to Libya.\\n\\nLawmakers want to know, among other things, about a trip Petraeus took to Libya the week of Oct. 31. They are curious about a report that was put together summarizing his meetings and which may include details of his personal interviews with the CIA station chief in Benghazi about the attack. A State Department consulate, as well as a CIA annex, came under heavy fire that night.\",\n          \"Trump Steps In To Help Oil Industry Facing Its Own Coronavirus Crisis\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Jeff Brady/NPR Jeff Brady/NPR\\n\\nOil prices bounced back a bit after President Trump said the Department of Energy would buy crude for the nation's strategic petroleum reserve.\\n\\n\\\"We're going to fill it right to the top,\\\" Trump said Friday in a wide-ranging news conference at the White House. He said it will save taxpayers \\\"billions and billions of dollars\\\" while helping an industry that's been reeling.\\n\\nWhile oil prices increased nearly 5% after Friday's announcement, that was just a fraction of the amount they lost earlier in the week.\\n\\nIn South Texas, Rudy Martinez immediately experienced the effects of the past week's collapse in crude oil prices.\\n\\n\\\"I actually have a little man camp and these guys are on the way out because they lost contracts,\\\" says Martinez, who has eight rooms he rents to out-of-town oilfield workers in Karnes City, Texas.\\n\\n\\\"The workers get their per-diem and I charge them $100 a person [per week]. Actually I'd like to charge them a little more than that, but now that it's tapered off, it's hard to charge them that because they can't pay it,\\\" he says.\\n\\nBack when the oil business was really booming in Karnes City, Martinez says he could charge up to $2000 a week per person.\\n\\nThis is one small example of what declining oil prices mean for the rural communities that depend on the oil business. And there's a lot at stake for the U.S., the world's largest producer of crude oil.\\n\\nOil prices had been falling out of fears the coronavirus epidemic threatened world economic growth. Demand was also down as large gatherings were canceled and people started staying home to avoid getting sick.\\n\\nThen prices plunged after Saudi Arabia and Russia failed to agree on production cuts and instead entered a price war last Sunday. In a stunning reversal, Saudi Arabia said it would actually boost oil production and offer a massive discount for its customers.\\n\\nU.S. oil companies, especially smaller ones, are now looking to make deep cuts. Industry analysts warn of possible bankruptcies, especially if oil remains where it's fallen to, in the $30 per barrel range. Companies operating in Texas's Eagle Ford Shale need prices between $40 to $60 a barrel to remain profitable.\\n\\n'We were here before the oil'\\n\\nKarnes City was transformed by the oil drilling boom that started about a decade back. Karnes County National Bank President Trip Ruckman says there were local farmers and ranchers who were just getting by, then all of a sudden showed up at his bank with a $1 million oil royalty check in hand.\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Jeff Brady/NPR Jeff Brady/NPR\\n\\nRight now it can still look pretty busy around town. There are trucks on the roads and a few local hotels are still full. Ruckman says it takes time for drillers to wind down production plans that already were being implemented when prices collapsed.\\n\\n\\\"Probably, in a few weeks to a month or two, I think you're going to see things slow down. But we'll still be here \\u2014 we were here before the oil,\\\" says Ruckman, who tries to stay optimistic about the financial future of his community.\\n\\nThere have been reports the Trump administration may be willing to help the oil industry in other ways. For example, the White House could reduce federal royalties for oil pumped on government land or offshore. The administration could also offer low-interest government-backed loans.\\n\\nGroups focused on climate change have criticized such ideas.\\n\\n\\\"The last people who deserve taxpayers' money are the billionaires that created and profited from the climate crisis,\\\" says Jack Shapiro of the environmental group Greenpeace.\\n\\nOne potential bright spot in all this is gasoline prices. Lower oil prices will mean cheaper gas for motorists in coming months.\\n\\nUsually when gas prices go down people drive more and choose bigger cars, which increases consumption. But with many limiting travel out of concern over the coronavirus, this time might be the exception.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"source_url\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"www.washingtontimes.com\",\n          \"www.foxnews.com\",\n          \"www.npr.org\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"bias_text\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"left\",\n          \"right\",\n          \"center\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"ID\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"z7wi9r2JRL6FOLNz\",\n          \"0IUulaZ8T8dkN0nh\",\n          \"VIXJiz0uAUrG9a0X\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

En términos de palabras similares a “economy”, Word2Vec genera vecinos más coherentes semánticamente como “sluggish”, “growth” o “slowdown”, que reflejan correctamente conceptos relacionados con economía. Por el contrario, FastText tiende a producir combinaciones raras o palabras compuestas como “economyand”, “economywide” o “economix”, lo que muestra su fortaleza en manejar subpalabras y palabras fuera de vocabulario, pero al costo de ruido semántico.\n",
